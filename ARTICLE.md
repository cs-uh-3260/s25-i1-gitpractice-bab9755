# Teach yourself programming in 10 years

This article goes over how to teach oneself programming in 10 years. While we see a lot of tutorials online claiming that they can teach us a language or framework in 5 hours, the artcile argues that learning to program is deeper than that and takes much more time. You can read the full essay [here](https://norvig.com/21-days.html).


# Summary

I think this artcile in interesting because this is also a trap that I fall into a lot. I get a lot of pressure from seeing job descriptions requiring the knowledge of so many programming languages and concepts that I should learn in next to no time. The other thing I like about the article and that I had not considered before is the fact that to get good at programming, we need to think in terms of decades, or at least one decade. It seems really overwhelming to think about doing the same thing over and over for 10 years or more, but the author explains beautiful that this is what it takes if we want to get our skills up to the next level. He also teaches us to go on our own pace and constantly seek challenges in the thing that we are trying to learn.
